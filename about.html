	Hi, My name is Lei. I am a graduate student at the university of Kansas, and i am interested in Data science, machine learning, and software designs. I have developed two mobile apps using different Javascript frameworks in the last two years, and i have helped my former advisor Dr.Huan designing a web application for machine learning platform. I have been coding primarily in Javascript, and i have used Angular.js and React Native frameworks. Right now, i am learning React.js and i am also interested in learning Python for my information retrieval project.
